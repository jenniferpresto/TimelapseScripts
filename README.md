###Timelapse scripts

Simplest--possibly the jenkiest--timelapse system ever created. More detailed readme to come.

* **simpleCam.sh**: Bash script set to run as cron job on Raspberry Pi
* **autoDownload.sh**: Logs into Raspberry Pi and downloads all pictures taken the prior day.
* **makeMovie.py**: Stitches still images together to mp4.
